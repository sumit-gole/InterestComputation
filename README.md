# PROBLEM STATEMENT 

## Interest Computation:
 
You were a very thrifty and money-savvy child. Instead of spending the money the tooth fairy gave you for your baby teeth, you invested that cash in one lump sum of $32.00 as a teenager, in a bank account with a fixed annual interest rate of 7.75%. 

- What is the balance of the account exactly 30 years later?

- What is the balance of the account exactly 30 years later, assuming interest is paid annually and reinvested.
